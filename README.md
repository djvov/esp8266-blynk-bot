## First firmware update of ESP8266

In Arduino IDE setup you need to put "http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json" at the line "Extend links to board manager".
Then go to the Board Manager and install ESP8266 community.
In the board menu choose your chip, my is Generic 8266.
Then your need to put esp8266 and FTDI programmator together as shown below.

Open Arduino OTA sketch from examples and write it.

Because in this robot I took all PINs to some tasks, we need to write firmware Over The Air. And first step is load OTA firmware to esp8266.

## ESP8266 to breadboard

I'll buy native esp8266 chip and white development borad. In the Fritzing schema I didn't find white pcb, so I put what I found, some black.
But, as white pcb, It's has some width as breadboard width. So we need to extend it by wire to another row. From 1 row to 9 row, from 2 row to 10 row, etc.

The yellow lines just to show hot to each  pin goes to its row after pcb.

## Full Schema

### POWER

First of all, two 18650 with serial connection to get 8.4v. With BMS plate to prevent overdischarge, and charge it with balance.
From battery block we need to build TWO special power lines: 3.3v for ESP8266, 5v for servo and HCâ€“SR04 sonar. And raw 8.4v power for motor drivers.
3.3v we get from LM1117DT-3.3, 5v we get from LM7805. In both case two ceramic 104 capacitor for IN and OUT to ground.
**IMPORTANT!** It is necessary to connect **ALL GROUNDS**

### MOTOR

I use MX1508 dual motors driver, analog of L298N. 1.5A per channel, 2.5A peak. With no heat sink. Becarefurl with VCC *+* and *-*.

I use two MX1508 dual motors drivers, becase  I have four wheels. One MX1508 drives two motors from same side. So we need to put IN1 and IN3 together, also IN2 and IN4, for same direction of two motors. This schema can use only two pins of ESP8266 instead of four pins.

Here is table of signal for direction, standby and brakes. Standby different from brake. Standby ends of power to motor, and motor stops by itself, it tooks some time. Brake stops motor immediately.
